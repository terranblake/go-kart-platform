# Task: Implement Motor Controller Component

## Overview
<!-- LLM_CONTEXT: task_overview -->
Implement the motors component to interface with the Kunray MY1020 3kW BLDC motor controller using the CrossPlatformCAN library. The implementation should be based on the test script in components/motors/test/BasicControllerTest.cpp, which has already verified the hardware connectivity and functionality.

**UPDATE:** Physical testing has been completed successfully with an Arduino Nano connected to the Kunray controller. We've confirmed operational functionality of the battery, controller, and motor components, and have integrated temperature sensors for monitoring all three major components.
<!-- LLM_CONTEXT_END -->

## Requirements
<!-- LLM_CONTEXT: requirements -->
- Implement motor control functions based on the test script (throttle, direction, speed mode, brakes)
- Use the CrossPlatformCAN library for communication
- Implement handlers for all motor commands defined in the protocol
- Support speed control (0-100%)
- Support direction control (forward/reverse)  
- Support speed modes (low/medium/high)
- Support brake control (low/high)
- Include proper status reporting over CAN
- Implement proper error handling and safety features
- Follow Arduino best practices for memory and resource usage
- **NEW:** Implement temperature monitoring for battery, controller, and motor using NTCLE100E3203JBD thermistors
- **NEW:** Include temperature-based safety features (throttle limitation and emergency stop)
<!-- LLM_CONTEXT_END -->

## Design
<!-- LLM_CONTEXT: design -->
The motors component will be structured as follows:

1. **Main Application Logic**:
   - Initialize motor controller pins and CAN interface
   - Register command handlers
   - Implement main loop for periodic status updates and sensor monitoring

2. **Motor Controller Interface**:
   - Functions to control motor parameters (speed, direction, mode, brakes)
   - Safety checks and limits to prevent dangerous operations
   - Monitoring of hall sensors for RPM calculation

3. **CAN Communication Layer**:
   - Command handlers for each supported command
   - Status reporting at regular intervals
   - Error reporting when problems occur

4. **Hardware Abstraction**:
   - Encapsulate direct hardware control in dedicated functions
   - Define pin assignments in Config.h (already exists)

**⚠️ DESIGN REVIEW CHECKPOINT**: Before proceeding to implementation, please confirm this design approach.

## Technical Constraints
<!-- LLM_CONTEXT: constraints -->
- Must use CrossPlatformCAN library for all CAN communication
- Must follow the protocol defined in protocol/motors.proto
- Throttle control should validate values and include safety limits
- Direction changes must ensure motor is stopped first
- Speed mode changes should be handled safely
- Brake control must prioritize safety (low brake takes precedence when both are engaged)
- Error handling must be robust and report issues via CAN
- Memory usage must be optimized for Arduino platform
- **NEW:** Temperature monitoring must follow Steinhart-Hart equation for accurate readings
- **NEW:** Temperature thresholds must be respected (see updated documentation)
<!-- LLM_CONTEXT_END -->

## Testing Strategy
<!-- LLM_CONTEXT: testing -->
- Unit tests:
  - Test handler functions in isolation
  - Test motor control functions with mock hardware
  - Test safety limits and validation logic
  - **NEW:** Test temperature calculation and thresholds

- Integration tests:
  - Test CAN message handling end-to-end
  - Test motor control sequences (similar to BasicControllerTest.cpp)
  - Test error reporting and recovery
  - **NEW:** Test temperature-based safety responses

- Manual verification:
  - ✅ Verify throttle response matches test script results
  - ✅ Verify direction changes work correctly
  - ✅ Verify speed modes provide expected behavior
  - ✅ Verify brake functionality works as expected
  - ✅ Verify RPM calculation with improved algorithm
  - Verify CAN status updates are sent at appropriate intervals
