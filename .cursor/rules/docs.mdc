you can find docs in a README.md format at each major component of the project. e.g. components/common/lib/CrossPlatformCAN, dashboard/server/README.md, and at the project root

after every commit in the relevant project space, go ahead and review the docs if the task added or changed capability, and the same goes for changes to a build or test process
