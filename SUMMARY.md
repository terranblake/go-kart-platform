# Go-Kart Platform: High-Level Architectural Summary

## Project Goal

To create a modular, extensible, and controllable platform for an electric vehicle (go-kart). The platform aims to standardize communication and control between various hardware components and provide capabilities for data logging and system monitoring.

## Core Architectural Concepts

1.  **Distributed System:** The architecture is based on a distributed model where multiple independent functional modules interact.
2.  **Central Control Unit:** A primary node responsible for overall system orchestration, user interface (if applicable), and potentially data aggregation. It issues commands to component modules and receives status updates from them.
3.  **Component Modules:** Specialized, independent hardware units responsible for specific functions (e.g., controlling lights, managing motors, reading sensors, handling power). Each module operates autonomously based on commands received and reports its status and relevant data.
4.  **Shared Communication Bus:** A standardized communication network connecting the central control unit and all component modules. This bus facilitates reliable, bidirectional message exchange.
5.  **Standardized Message Protocol:** A well-defined message format used for all communication over the bus. This protocol ensures interoperability and defines message types such as commands, status updates, data reports, acknowledgments, and error notifications.
6.  **Modularity and Extensibility:** The design allows for easy addition, removal, or modification of component modules without requiring significant changes to the core system, provided they adhere to the communication protocol.
7.  **Data Logging / Telemetry:** A dedicated subsystem or capability within the central unit responsible for collecting, storing, and potentially analyzing operational data transmitted by the component modules over the communication bus.

## Key Interactions

-   The **Central Control Unit** sends command messages to specific **Component Modules** via the **Communication Bus** using the defined **Message Protocol**.
-   **Component Modules** execute commands and send status or data messages back to the **Central Control Unit** (and potentially other modules) via the **Communication Bus**.
-   The **Data Logging** system captures relevant messages from the **Communication Bus** for storage and later analysis.
